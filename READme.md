# Neighborhood Project FEND
---

This project was created from scratch as a part of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program. This Charlotte Craft Brewers single page application displays my favorite local breweries and lets the user filter the results via the search bar. This project uses the Google Maps API to display a map as well as the Foursquare API to display some detailed information.
